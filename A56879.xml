            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. VVHether any, and if any, what parte of the Articles of the <hi>Cessation</hi> with the Lord of Inchiquin is against the Catholicke Religion, or iust ground for an Excommunication?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether you hold the appeale by us made and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed within the time limitted by the Canon law, and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles being granted therevpon, be a suspension of the Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie Excommunication, and Interdict, and of the effects, and consequences thereof, and of any other proceedings or Censures, in pursuance of the same?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Considering that the propositions of the Lord Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio now printed, were offered by his Lordship as a meane whereby to make the Cessation conscionable, whether our answers therevnto, likwise printed, are so short, or unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, and wherein, as they might affoord iust grounds for an Excommunication?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether the opposing of the Cessation against the positiue order of the Councell by one who hath sworne the Oath of Association, be periury?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whether if it shalbe found, that the said Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication and Interdict is against the law of the Land, as in Catholicke time it was practised, and which lawes by the Oath of Association all the Prelats of this land are bound to maintaine, can their Lordships (notwith standing and contrary to the positiue orders of the Supreame Councell to the contrarie) countenance or publish the said Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, or Interdict?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Whether a dispensation may be given vnto any person or parties of the Confederats, to breake the Oath of Associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation without the consent of the Generall Assembly, who framed it, as the bond and ligament of the Catholick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy and union in this Kingdome; the alteration or dissolution whereof being by their orders reserved onely vnto themselves?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Whether any person of the Confederats upon pretence of the present proceedings of the Lord Nuncio, may disobey the orders of the Supreame Councell?</p>

               <p>And although VVe are not ignorant how the Deane of <hi>Firmo</hi> by authority from the Lord <hi>Nuncio</hi> published Commands, Censures and penalties against all Divines &amp; Canonists
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41085:5"/> who should deliver their opiniōs for the <hi>cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiō</hi> untill, or before they had accoasted his Lord ship, and Congregation, to heare from them the reasons which oppose it; yet in regarde it appeares unto us evidently after mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration and exact debate, that such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds, Censures, and penalties are not onely most unreasonable and unjust, but also inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, since they would take away from us that just liberty, which throughout all the world, is of right belonging to, and absolutly requisit to be resident in Divines, <hi>viz.</hi> to answer Cases of Conscience occurring or proposed [it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwise impossible for them, eyther to governe their owne consciences or direct others, but all should often live in tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting perplexities; which is repugnant to the law of God) And since our going to the Lord <hi>Nuncio</hi> and Congregation, would be to no other purpose, then to heare and see his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships objections against the cessation; all which we have already, to the least word, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vsed in the Bookes given us by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships directions (for there can be no kinde of likelyhood, that wee should receive from his Lordship or Congregation, any better or stronger reasons; then what hee hath given

                        <hi>Verba Layma.</hi> Dico IV. Si Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholici cum hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticis publicū foedus ineant, non potest per auctoritatem Pontificiam solvi, aut relaxari. Haec est doctrina à Ioanne Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lano praecipué intenta. Probatur: Licet enim, si quaedam praecisé spectentur, videlicet quod hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retici propter Baptismū, Ecclesiasticae iurisdictioni subiecti sunt; &amp; ob odium ac poenam ipsorum, iure compellantur ad remissionem foederis in Ecclesiae detrimentum cedentis: aut, si recusent, ipsis etiam invitis relaxatio fieri queat, per supremam Ecclesiasticam potestatem; attamen, spectatis omnibus, adeòque absoluté negari debet, id à summo Pontifice fieri posse. Quando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidem is non habet potestatem dispensandi aut relaxandi in detrimentū Ecclèsiae; talis autem, relaxatio cederet in gravissimum Ecclesiae detrimentum: quia cúm haeretici Catholicae Fidei hostes, in omni foedere cum Catholicis inito exclusam velint Papalem relaxandi potestatem; ideo apud ipsos, &amp; omnes nationes infideles blasphemabitur nomen Domini, &amp; Religio Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholica in contemptum veniet, &amp; plura mala ingentia sequentur, si dicatur, nos cum Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficis nostri consensu, foedera publica, contra ius gentium, erga hostes nostros violare. Hoc au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem tam grave malum est, ut nullum incommodum seu detrimentum Ecclesiae Catholicae, ex foederis observatione inferendum, ita magnum videri debeat sperantibus in Deo, &amp; Christo summo Ecclesiae defensore, qui auxilium sort in tempore opportuno.</p>
                     <p>Verúm haretici huius temporis Calvinistae egregié astuti sunt. Vt enim impunè ipsis liceat pacta cum Catholicis inita violare, causam praetexunt, quód Iesuitae, &amp; alij Catholici do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceant, fidem haereticis (quales se esse conscientia ipsis dictat) servandam esse: talibus autem, qui fidem violare parati sunt, fidem servari non oportere: cúm tamen interim fidem publicam à Catholicis violatam fuisse, nullo exemplo oftendere possint, multó minùs, quod Catholici Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctores in ea, quam dicunt, sententia sint, <hi>Fidem haereticis servand am non esse.</hi> Ecce enim tam Iesustae, quam alij Doctores Catholici contrarium apertè profitentur ac docent: fidem publicam haereticis datam, inviolabiliter, &amp; sine ullo dispensationis, aut absolutionis reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio servandam esse, quamdiu ipsi servare parati sint.</p>
                  </note> out of which doctrine these great diuines most soundly &amp; religiously infer that even his Holinesse cannot dispense in this straight tye of fidelity:</p>
               <p>Supposing (we say) both these <hi>tenets</hi> as they cannot but be uncontroulably admitted, our answer to the first question is, That sithence it is manifest by what is said, how a truce, league or peace with enemies of our faith, is not in it selfe unlawfull, especially where eyther the necessity or profit or advancement of the affaires of true Religion expected thence doe warrant it, and since it is no lesse cleere, how its against conscience to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41085:7"/> fall, contrary to promise given, from such publicke contracts, or faith engaged, since likewise none of the articles of <hi>Cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> with the Lord of <hi>Inchiquyn</hi> (eyther in their owne nature, according any common or proper sense the words may have, or taken together with the circumstances of the time &amp; condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Confederats were in at their conclusion) involves any <hi>evill,</hi> we must confesse and averre none of the said articles to be against <hi>Catholicke Religion,</hi> or <hi>iust ground for Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> this just ground implying in it selfe an evill (and a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall evill<note n="(o)" place="margin">Suar. tom. <hi>5.</hi> de Censu. disp. <hi>4</hi> sect. <hi>4.</hi> &amp; alij omnes.</note> or sin) according to the unanimous consent of all Divines, yea an exterior and visible<note n="(p)" place="margin">See the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors on Bulla Coena, where they treat of ex communication against Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes. Reade likewise the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in their treatises of laws and where they inquire whether interior acts of the minde may be commaunded or prohibited, or whether the sins of the heart, as wicked intentiōs &amp;c, not sufficiēt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discovered in the exteriour, may be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by holy Church, as with Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or otherwise? and they answer negatiuely. Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. l. <hi>1.</hi> de leg. tract. <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>4.</hi> assert. <hi>7.</hi> cites thē in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. And indeed the very Canons expresly define this truth, cap. Sicut. de Simon. &amp; cap. Tua nos. eodem titul.</note> sin, as they teach. And that no such evill lyeth hidden in these articles, or any thing disadvantagious to <hi>Catholicke Religion,</hi> wee are certainely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded it may be evident to any that will take away the filme.</p>
               <p>First, because there is not a word in them eyther po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively (as it is manifest) or negatively (if all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances be considered) against Religion, justice, or good life: and, which is farre more, that by the second and fifth, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall provision is made for the advancement of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> throughout all the said Lord of <hi>Iuchiquyns</hi> quarters, (a few Garrisons excepted) by free exercise of Catholicke Religion and function (yea by possession of Churches and Church li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, where we held them at the comencement of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) in as ample manner as in our owne quarters. VVhich que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionlesse is no small advantage to Religion, and which could not be acquired by warre hitherto, though the hazard cost much bloud, and many lives to the <hi>Confederats.</hi>

               <p>Secondly in regard of the then present great necessity of our affaiers: the power of the enemy so encreased in all parts of the Kingdome &amp; particularly in <hi>Mounster;</hi> all ports, besides five or sixe, and maritime places of any consequence in the whole Iland (which are at least twenty) being in their hands; neere two parts of three of the in-land being eyther in their quiet possession or forraged by them, &amp; under contribution; their Armies victorious, their Fleet giving lawes to us at Sea, and shutting up our Havens; two vast Kingdomes, within sixe (or twelve houres sayle, the furthest of) to backe them, to support their charges, and repayre their losses: and on the other side, the <hi>Confederats</hi> fallen to such an ebb, and sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41085:8"/> our two most flourishing Armies defeated, and brought to nothing; our quarters over-run by foure severall enemies, burnt, wasted, and for no lesse then a third part of what was ours intirely even last yeare, made now tributary: our owne forces of the <hi>Vlster army</hi> devouring what was left by the common enemie, and in hostile-wise destroying all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which by others were untoucht, and which before this crueltie were able to, and really did support the most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable proportions of the charges of warre; our <hi>Exchequer</hi> hence both emptie, and altogether hopelesse to get in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys from a countrey so totally exhausted, and so lamentably ruined; our expectations of great summes and helpes from beyond Seas, being turnd to winde, smoake and despayre, for any thing hath yet appeared; or if some little quantitie be come, it being feared, that it should be given for maintayning sides, and supporting factions against the <hi>Government</hi> (as we have seene in effect proved;) no common Granaries for the <hi>Publicke,</hi> and but verie small store of graine with any privat persons, in so great a dearth of corne, as <hi>Ireland</hi> hath not seene in our memorie, and so cruell a famine, which hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie killed thousands of the poorer sort; and therefore no possibilitie to keepe an Armie in the field, though no other want had beene but that of bread, and if enemies were (as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto) comming on us from the foure windes; lastly so much dissention, such distance, and such malignant hatred twixt our selves within the body of the <hi>Confederats,</hi> as the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser sort did (not without cause) conceave to be too ominous, and to weaken us no lesse then could the strongest Armie of our enemies: an ebb so low, and a condition so sad of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, that according humane hopes there was no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood without a <hi>Cessation</hi> with some one partie, they might subsist this Summer eyther by a <hi>defensive</hi> warre in all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, or an <hi>offensive</hi> in one, and a <hi>defensive</hi> in the rest. Yet by the <hi>Cessation</hi> they might be so enabled, that according much probabilitie, <hi>Religion</hi> might be planted this season where <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie</hi> is most insolent and powerfull of any place in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. For, if that partie of the <hi>Confederats</hi> which now op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the <hi>Cessation,</hi> were obedient, &amp; together with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Marquesse</hi> of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> (drawne by this <hi>Cessation</hi>

               <p>Thirdly it is cleere, The Cessation is so far from disaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taging Religion, as there could hardly be a better way thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght of to further it. Whence followeth, that not onely necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (which hath bene now declared) but also vtilitie or great aduantage gotten by it for the Cause doth warrant it; since by the Articles <hi>Inchiquin</hi> himselfe, with his victorious Army, is bound to display these colours for vs, which soe many times we groaned to see against vs. More indeed then the nature of a <hi>Cessation</hi> draweth alonge with it: and (if it be taken together with the former benefit of the second &amp; fift Article, &amp; with the care had, that the Lord of <hi>Inchiquins Protestant party</hi> should not enioye the like benefit or liberty of either their function or Religion in our quarters) more, it is plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, to the honour &amp; profit of our Faith, then the greatest &amp; most Catholick Kings, &amp; Emperours performed in the like occasions.</p>
               <p>Certainly we know, the Kinge of <hi>Spaine</hi> hath (to pass over the present peace, so longe exspected &amp; so much spoken of) almost in our owne memory concluded a truce of twelue yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res with the <hi>Hollanders</hi>

               <p>Neither do they weaken these our grounds, who obiect the <hi>Declaration</hi> made by the Lord <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and <hi>Congregation,</hi> against the <hi>Cessation,</hi> and before it was concluded: as though, it were unlawfull after that <hi>Declaration,</hi> which before was cons<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionable: for who sees not, but the said <hi>Declaration</hi> (as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest in the words of it,) did presuppose unlawfullnesse in the <hi>nature</hi> of that agreement, Which was then to be made? and that therefore it was issued, to admonish the people and diuert them from it which was in <hi>it selfe</hi> thought evill (not evill by reason of any protestation, or manifestation made thereof by the <hi>Cleargie:</hi> who certainely by no meanes would confess, it was their owne declaration that made it unlawfull.)

The question was, whether it were sufficient for the Appellant to prove before the Iudge <hi>to whom to whom,</hi> that his cause was probable, although perhaps not true?

For the giving of the <hi>apostles</hi> is nothing else but a bare answer to the <hi>appeale,</hi> which the Law permits him to give either <hi>dimissory</hi> or <hi>refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatory,</hi> that is either <hi>admitting</hi> or <hi>reiecting</hi> (the appeale) either <hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong,</hi> but at his owne perill if he give not a right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, and admit the appeale when it is from a just and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grievance, and hath in it expressed probable causes; the Law providing likewise for the libertie and safetie of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellant, that whatsoever answer this be, he is not bound to conforme himselfe to it (if it be to his disadvantage) since he hath once l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Nay a little before <hi>Inchiquyn</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for his Maiestie did not he approve a cessation to be made even with him? VVhat is the reason of so much desire expressed for making a Cessation with the Parliamentary <hi>Scots,</hi> rather then with <hi>Inchiquyn,</hi> or others? or why with <hi>Inchiquyn</hi> himselfe when he was for the Parliament, and not much more now when he is for the King? Neither doth the Lord <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cios</hi> answer seeme in any wise to satisfie, where he sayes in another of his Letters (to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse this) that his intention in his former Letters or Messages was, to have an accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or league made with him, not a cessation: for who is it conceaves not, that a cessation of Armes with sectaries must be conscionable, (even by the Lord <hi>Nuncios</hi> owne concession) and no iust ground for Excommunication, if an accommodation or league be lawfull: since the cessation of its owne nature brings along with it lesse communication with them, or hinderance to annoy them.</note>) but rather that it was fixed on with intention to bring in the late reiected peace, and for other consequences following that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse; and consequently, that they conceaued no truth in the causes alleadged. For in case we did graunt their suspicions to be true before God (as they are not) yet nothing hence may be inferrd for disproouing the lawfulnesse of the appeale, <hi>in foro exteriori,</hi> (wherein onely they proceed): since they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not denye but the causes alleadged are such as if they can be proued, they ought to be thought lawful: and since they are not to be iudges herein; as hath been now seene by so many canons, glosses, and reasons: and lastly since we are <hi>bona fide</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of the probability (if not evidence) of our motives; nay though we had no <hi>bona fides</hi> interiourly, but only seemed exteriourly to have it.

               <p>Wherefore, it being now cleere from first to last, both out of our solutions to al is, or may be objected against the appeale and out of our positive reasons for it, that according the pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cript of Canons and sence of Doctours, it hath all the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a iust appeale, and that the Lord Nuntio and Delegats are even by the law deprived of all or any power to question, examine, or iudge the reasonablenesse or iustice thereof, or to cast any obligation on vs (either before God or the world) to submit to his or their iudgment in this behalfe: it must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by a necessary consequence out of what is formerlie said, That your Lordships Appeale doth not onely by the Canons, but also by the sence of Doctors suspend the censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, their effects and consequences, and al other proceedings of the Lord Nuntio, Delegats, Subdelegats (and of al and every, or any other deriving power from him or them) on the same ground. For that, as we haue formerly seene, their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is, That a just Appeale, of its owne nature, and as soone as tis interposed, hath a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and ech of the sayed effects.</p>
               <p>And hence they may be fully satisfied who hetherto were perswaded, or feareful through their owne ignorance, or haue beene deluded by the disaffected, who of purpose throw scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples into mens consciences without law or reason, takeing oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion by the kinde of <hi>Apostles</hi> the Lord Nuncio granted which are <hi>refutatories,</hi> not <hi>reverentials,</hi> or <hi>dimissories,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the simple that by reason these <hi>refutatories</hi> were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and not <hi>reverentials,</hi> the appeale can be of no force. Which erring assertion is plainely convinced by what hath beene alreadie said. For since it is manifested, that the reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse, justice or lawfulnesse of an appeale depends not of the Iudges brest or answer unto it (which they call <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi>) but is to be accounted such, if the causes alleaged in it seem evident, probable, or likely, or would be thought proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in case their truth might be proved: and since it is no lesse evident, that a <hi>refutatory</hi> (that is to say, a rejecting) answer proceeding either from the malice, negligence, corruption or ignorance of the Iudge, or from any other motive whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, cannot make the appeale unreasonable which before the answer was in it selfe reasonable, and contained the expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion of causes either evidently or probably iust; since lastly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41085:19"/> it hath been proved, that a iust or lawfull appeale, of its owne nature suspends the Iudge from being any more Iudge of the appellant, from iurisdiction over him, or power to question the lawfulnesse of his appeale; how can <hi>refutatorie apostles</hi> (gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Iudge as answer to the said appeale) have the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to hinder these suspensive effects? If it be said, that the Canons, which thus deprive the Iudge are not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of him whē he gives <hi>apostles refutatories,</hi> we must say this is a most ridiculous evasion, and meere non sence. Certainly they were not made against Iudges who give reuerencials, or dimissorie <hi>apostles.</hi> For what Iudge, who gave <hi>reverencial<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Neither have they beene instituted onely against Iudges, who denie both kindes; in regard the words of the Text are not, by any proper or common sence they may have, restrained to any such limitation, nor by the adioyning Glosses or opinion of Doctors commenting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but may and ought, according their proper meaning, to be understood generally in all cases of iust appeales, whether apostles be given or no, whether they be <hi>refutatories</hi> or <hi>dim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But to unmaske wholly the non-sence of this evasion, let us observe the absurditie, and contradiction which thence doth follow, For if cap. <hi>Si à Iud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41085:19"/> that the Iudge by an uniust act (that is by giving such an ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall answer, or <hi>apostles refutatories,</hi> when he should have given <hi>dimissories</hi>) reapes a benefit, to wit, recovers the iurisdiction and power which before was suspended by (and from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant of) the <hi>appeale</hi> interposed untill that present of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>refutatories.</hi> And if it be said, that his jurisdiction was not so suspended, untill the daies passed, which are allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed by the law for deliberating on the apostles; then, besides that this is against the Text, a plaine contradiction followes in the Canons and Glosses (which is) that during this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervall, the said Iudge <hi>from whom</hi> may call in question, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine juridically, give sentence, &amp;c of the lawfulnesse, or unlawfulnesse of the appeale, (since he is not restrained of his power, during this intervall▪) and yet all Canons and Glosses affirme the contrarie, as we have before seene. The like contradiction followes, if any confesse (as he must) that indeede the Iudge could not proceede during the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall of time twixt the appeale made, and apostles given, but will neverthelesse say, that he may, presently after the apostles when they are refutatorie; here is, we say, the like contradiction, in regard that, if the appeale was at first rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and just, it remaines so alwaies notwithstanding the refutatorie apostles unjustly given; and consequently by all the foresaid Canons, Glosses, and even by naturall equitie, the Iudge cannot proceede to the execution of his sentence, and by the Canons, and Glosses, he is no Iudge, he hath no jurisdiction, he cannot examine, or call in question the causes of the appeale, neither is the appellant bound to answer his summons. Certainely if he could proceede to the execution of the sentence, he might summon him, and examine the causes of the appeale, both because, that the examination of these causes might make him alter his sentence, which was in it selfe perhaps wholly unjust, and because it is therefore said, he might proceede to this execution, in asmuch as it is supposed he lost no part of his jurisdiction by the interposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the appeale, since he gave onely refutatories. If therefore he have in this case a plenarie jurisdiction over the appellant, why cannot he summon him concerning the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the appeale, or why is not the appellant in this case bound to obey him? It cannot be said, that the lawes exempt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41085:20"/> the appellant in this particular from him; for the verie prime Text which can be alleaged for this, to wit cap. <hi>Si à Iudice.</hi> de <hi>appellat.</hi> in 6. exempts him likewise in all other cases, and declares the Iudge to be no more Iudge over the appellant. And if they say, being reduced to extremities, that the Iudge <hi>á quo</hi> may call in question even the causes of the appeale, and judge them, then they engage themselves against all the Canons, Glosses, and Doctors, and against all their reasons, whereof that is insoluble which we have before produced in the <hi>Glosse</hi> of cap. <hi>Sollicitudinem.</hi> extr. <hi>de appellat.</hi> verb. <hi>Ep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For who is that upon unjust grounds would give sentence against any, upon his just appeale give him only refutatorie apostles, would not also give sentence against him in the causes of the appeale, for maintenance of his own jurisdiction and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, or perhaps in prosecution of his former ignorance, corruption, malice or spleene, if the law did enable him with power to be Iudge in this case? Whence further would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the subiect would be often remedilesly exposed to the tyrannie of everie unjust and partiall Iudge. This very same is a reason most sufficient, and discovered unto us by the light of nature, why we must hold that it lyes not in the Iudges brest to disanull just appeales by giving refutatories (whether it be granted or denied that he is Iudge of the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.) For otherwise an ignorant, corrupt, or malicious Iudge, (notwithstanding his most illegall proceedings) might overthrow at his pleasure, the most reasonable and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie appeales in the world; innocencie might be oppressed without remedie, and all injustice and tyrannie mantayned, if (we say) the Iudge for having given refutatories might proceede to execution during the said just appeale: for the execution may be an evill irecoverable by any addresse might
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41085:20"/> be made after, as indeed it would be in our case, were it allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. VVhich how repugnant it is to the verie law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to the intention and ayme of holy Canons, who doth not see?</p>
               <p>It was this convincing reason (we may justly thinke) made Glossa in cap. <hi>Licet.</hi> de sentent. <hi>Excom.</hi> in 6. mantaine our assertion in the like case, where the Iudge gave only apostles refutatories. Which is the second argument we make use of to remove this blocke whereat some seeme to stumble, For though the words of Glossa be not the verie Text of the law, yet no man can denie but in such a businesse they are a sufficient president for us: and no man can denie (who is versed in Canons or Canonists) but this verie Glosse is next after the Text of esteeme, and of more authoritie then fortie Doctors who should maintaine the contrarie, if they produced not the expresse letter of the law to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, or some Glosse as cleerely for the opposit assertion, as this for ours, or at least some reason convincing a naturall equitie for the adverse opinion. None of which as wee are sure they could not as yet produce, so wee are confident, they shall neuer be able hereafter to produce.

               <p>The obiections made by the Aduersaries are al of straw: and are partly dissolued alreadie, and the rest do heer follow. One is: That the Iudg doth not giue waye to the <hi>suspensiue effect</hi> of an appeale when he giues <hi>refutatorie apostles:</hi> as appeares out of the <hi>Glosse</hi> in cap. <hi>Cordi nobis.</hi> de Appellat in 6. §. <hi>exhiberi.</hi> Al which we confesse, and is too manifest for to make any matter of dispute, by reason that the very act of giuing <hi>Refutatories</hi> is a denyal of giuing waye to the <hi>suspensiue effect</hi> of the <hi>appeale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore the Glosse very wel &amp; truly sayes that the Iudg denyeth (in asmuch as in him lyes) to giue Waye to this suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue effect when he giues <hi>refutatories.</hi> But neither doth that Glosse, nor any other, nor likewise any text of law, or Doctour saye that the Iudg by his illegal denyeing to giue waye to this <hi>suspensiue effect</hi> of a iust appeale, can hinder or take awaye <hi>in rei veritate</hi> before God or man from the appeale iustly interposed this effect annexed to it <hi>exnatura re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> by the canons; though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he doe (but vnconscionably, sinnefully, inualidly, and at his owne peril) as much as in him lyeth to hinder it. Wherefore though he giue not this waye, yet the law giueth it when the appeale is from <hi>a iust or probable grieuance.</hi> as appeares euidently out of al the fore-mentioned Glosses, Doctours and canons, and by the very light of reason.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:41085:21"/>
               <p>Another obiection is formed out of c. cum speciali. de. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellationibus. 2. §. Porro. c. Romana Ecclesia. eod. tit. in 6. §. si uero. &amp;. §. sententia quoque Glossa in cap. vt super appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione. eod. §. nota insuper. c. non solum. eod. cum clara Glossa. c. cum appellationibus. eod. cum Glossa. §. nota insuper. &amp;. §. nota primo. c. licet. de senten. excom. in 6. &amp; glossa ibi: §. nota ex hoc. whence they deduce, That what the Iudg <hi>a quo</hi> doth in prosecution of the cause, after <hi>apostles refutatorie</hi> giuen by him as answer to an appeale made from him is of such force and effect in law, That the Iudg <hi>ad quem,</hi> or <hi>to whom</hi> the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale is made, cannot recal the sentence giuen by the Iudg <hi>from whom,</hi> vntil the validitie of the appeale be proued or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued before him: and if disprooued, that he cannot proceed in the principal matter, but must remit the whole to the first Iudg: but if proued, that then he may absolue the appellant from al censures renued after such an appeale, and so proceed to examine the principal matter. And hence is further deduced, that when such refutatorie apostles are giuen, the appellant is not exempted from the jurisdiction of the Iudg <hi>from whom,</hi> otherwise the Iudg <hi>to whom</hi> likely would presently recal the proceedings, &amp; al acts done by the Iudg <hi>a quo,</hi> after the appeale made from him.

VVhich doctrine they make evident with many strong and perspicuous reasons (vnnecessarie to be now rehearsed) and specially declare it out of holy Scripture, 2. Cor. 13.10. where <hi>S. Paul</hi> tels, that Christ consigned his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer unto the Prelats of the Church <hi>non in destructionem, sed in aedificationem, not for destruction, but for edification.</hi> But who sees not, that this power would be abused for destruction, and not for edification, if on pretence of it, and without a manifestly iust cause dispensations should be granted in the law divine positive and naturall? And who is it that lookes on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federats and their present condition with an unpartiall eye, but will conceive that there cannot be a iust cause for dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with them, or particulars of them in their oath of Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, or with them in their obedience due by the said Oath to the government established. First, in regard the sole cause pretended is the <hi>Cessation</hi> made, and observed with <hi>Inchiquyn</hi> which we have notwithstanding proved to have beene law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, necessarie, profitable, and much to the advancement of the Catholicke cause, were it obeyed by refractories, and per consequence of the glorie of God. How then could it be a iust cause for dispensing with any in the oath of Association, or in the obedience due by the said Oath to all Orders of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Councell, or all such Orders as doe not manifestly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be sinnefull? Secondly because such a dispensation breeds sedition, stirs rebellion, commenceth <hi>a</hi> Civill warre, and devides the Confederates into parties, throwes fire and bloud into their verie entrailes, and by their owne hands, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally weakens them so by these wayes of mutuall enmities and hostilities, as hereby in reason they should be thought to be exposed as a prey to the common enemie of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Is there any one knowes <hi>Ireland,</hi> but should in reason have perswaded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that all these evils should have followed such a dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if God did not prevent them by a miracle?<note place="margin">S.

And is there any man of sence will say, that a dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which draweth along with it so much evill could either be in it selfe iust, or have a iust cause, specially where the cause pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended is the declining of a sin <hi>in adhering to a Cessation,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or in which <hi>adhering</hi> we have manifestly proved no sinne could be committed? nay we have evinced the said Cessation could not be not adhered unto, or could not be reiected by the Councell and Confederates without most grievous and fearefull sinnes: and wee have shewed this to be the constant doctrine of the Catholicke Divines, and of the Church of God, and that when the contrarie was practised through an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and temeritie, the experience was fatall, and cost them deere. Thirdly by reason of the disesteeme it would bring upon all confederacie, &amp; of the unsecuritie, manifest danger, &amp; confusion it would bring vpon, and throw into all Christian states and governments: for if by such dispensations, and upon such grounds the common subject could be withdrawne from his allegeance, and with a good conscience rebell, what Prince what state, or Republicke, nay what privat man could live one day in securitie, whereas they often see before their faces such boundlesse, enraged ambition, &amp; such cruell designes of some Prelats? (may this be spoken without disparagement to so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other great and good Prelats, who by their vertuous lives &amp; apostolicall doctrine support States, Kingdomes, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies of Christianitie: as in particular severall are seene to use with us at this present, such prayse worthy endevours for the preservation of the Confederats,) If together with this example it were mantained as a Catholicke <hi>Tenet,</hi> That such Prelats or Churchmen could at their pleasure or upon such designes challenge, &amp; assume a power of the fortunes, estates,

Lastly (which is hence consequent) by reason of the aversion and hatred it would breed in all Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels and sectaries against our Religion. For what Prince, State, or Common-wealth of any other Religion would admit of ours, if our doctrins of dispensations in the subjects allegeance were so destructive of all policie and good government, and so cruelly wicked? Let us therefore here and evermore stop our Christian eares from such blasphemies against the law of God and the faith of the holy Roman and universall Church in all ages to this present time. And let us leave such antichristian principles to <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> &amp; such other infernall furies, who covered a great part of Europe with the bloud of Christians, by doctrine in substance not unlike this (but certainely no worse then this) and whereby they at their pleasures armed the subject against the Prince, and the people against the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>VVhence is apparant, how unsatisfactorie and ignorant their answer is, who to excuse their disobedience to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, alleage the commaunds of their spirituall Superiours, Guardians, Pryors, Provincials, Bishops, the Lord Nuncio, &amp;c. to the contrarie: as if such commaunds or of such supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, or of any else whosoever, temporall or spirituall were of more force to oblige their consciences then the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God, and then his law, which (according the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration made thereof unto us by <hi>S.

First, that the Declaration and Censures of the Lord Nuncio, Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Delegats (in obedience to which they disobey the Councell) were not against such evill intentions, but against the verie substance of the articles of Cessation, as in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves evill &amp; unconscionable. Tis manifest to any that please to reade and peruse the Tenour of both Decrees, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne not a word importing other sence, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be extended to evill intentions (though we granted such intentions to had beene) in regard a penall Decree or law is to be restrained, not extended,<note place="margin">Bon. tract. de Legib, disp. <hi>1.</hi> q. <hi>1.</hi> punct. <hi>8.</hi> prop. <hi>2.</hi> &amp; alij apud ipsum ibid.</note> according the maxime of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonists.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41085:29"/> Wherefore this recourse of theirs to evill intentions, and their not shewing any other evill in the obiect, that is in the Cessation itselfe, or in the conclusion and observation of it, concludes an errour in the Decree or sentence of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and consequently disanuls it, and leaves them no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable pretence for disobeying the Councell since their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is the supposed obligation of the Censures which even their owne answer takes away. The second is: Though it were granted that the Councell or others who negotiated th'affaire of Cessation, had such intentions at first, or upon the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, yet might they have changed such evill intentions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to good, during the nine daies given in the monitorie Decree for deliberation: and consequently if there be no other evill but of their intentions, how could the Nuncio proceede to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute his Censures since they protested in their appeale before the ninth day and in other Printed Declarations, that they had no such intention? Nay how could he proceede to this execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though they never had made any such exteriour protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereas without it, they might have taken away the ground of the excommunication, to wit the supposed evill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions?

How then could such be excommunicated, since the ground of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, to wit evill intention, is not found in them? And if these be not excommunicated, is it not plaine that none is excommunicated whose conscience tels him, that he did not adhere to the Cessation with any evill intention? How then doth the Nuncio proceeds indifferently against them all as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated persons? Nay how can he proceede against any of them as such, but onely against him or them whose naughty intentions are apparant? and whose intentions can be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to him, but either out of confession, or secundum allegata &amp; probata by exteriour proofes?

VVhich, together with all hetherto said, being duely pondered by them who now seeme so adverse to us in opinion, but by them discharged a little of passion, retyring into their soules, and looking with an eye of indifferencie upon this difference, we doubt not but they will acknowledge before God, the truth of our assertions, and with how little reason, but great hazard of eternall salvation they disobey the commaunds of the Supreme Councell on pretence of the present proceedings of the Lord Nuncio; and we hope, as we most heartily desire with all our soules, that they, or at least such of them as have an affection to loyaltie, and a true zeale of Gods cause, will by their unfayned and repentant submission to the Supreme Authoritie, established by the Kingdome, make happy these Answers, (labour'd as the shortnesse of time did permit) for their conversion, and satisfaction of all good Patriots, by</p>
